#What to expect when you transform an organization to Scrum?#

###Expect Resistors###
Moving to Scrum will expose many emotions of the people in your organization.  At various times people will be happy, neutral,
or Unhappy.  And not at predictable times.  See Tuckman's model for some predictability (insert link).  Not to fear, there is good
news for the Scrum Master trying to "deal" with the neutral & unhappy people.  

####Help from Mike Cohen####
Cohen helps Scrum Master's and coaches by classifying the types of resistors.  And he makes the argument that these are the people
we should be listening to the most.  See [https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/four-types-of-resistors-when-adopting-agile]

####Common Resistor Arguments####
* Longer Sprints will make the transition easier - *_FALSE_* [http://www.agileforall.com/2011/09/why-longer-sprints-probably-wont-help/]
