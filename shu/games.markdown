Humans and other animals are hardwired to create, discover, and play games. Games are not only fun, but help us learn.  

Games can be literal. Teams that struggle to swarm can practice the same skill by building physical objects together, as in the Marshmallow Challenge. Teams that struggle with listening and attentiveness can develop these skills with improv games like one word story and zip zap zop. These kinds of games can also create cameraderie and help people get out of their comfort zones in a safe and fun way. A great resource for more improv games is http://improvencyclopedia.org/games/. There are also games specifically designed to help teams visualize their work, understand their customers better, and more at http://gamestorming.com/category/wiki/.

Games can also be more subtle than the examples above. In improv, players are taught to "find the game" - that means to be alert for patterns and be prepared to exploit them to build a scene. For a Scrum Master, finding the game could mean noticing who in the team has great ideas first thing in the morning and is brain dead by 3 PM. Once you've seen that pattern, now you have a chance to help the team exploit it.

What kinds of problems do you see that could be tackled with a game?
