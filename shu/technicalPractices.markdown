In all likelyhood a new scrum master would a "hands-on" developer. Whether or not a scrum master has a technical background or not, they should strive to have some baseline knowledge of some technical practices. This will have a number of positive affects:
*Increase the confidence of the scrum master
*Increase the credibibilty of the scrummaster with their team(s)
*Eat their own dog food. Scrum masters are in the habit of telling teams of the importance of being multi-skilled(t-shaped), this will force many new scrum masters out of their own comfort zone.
*There is a risk of a new scrum master to become entirely focused on the people & process side of Scrum. Scrum lives in the domain of technology and as such a scrum master must understand that domain in order to become more effective. A shu level scrum master should understand the theory behind the concepts. A ha level scrum master would start to get their hands dirty.
